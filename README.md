# Function-Generator-Using-Arduino-Uno

In this project we will make Function Generator using Arduino Uno. Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P, for writing the code we will use Arduino Uno IDE compiler and for running it we use PROTEUS which is a simulation tool. This project includes development of a function generator using Arduino Uno, 8-bit DAC, Varying Frequency Circuit, Button Switch Circuit and a 16x2 LCD to generate waveforms of different frequencies and also involves a decent knowledge about Astable Multivibrator, Integrator and LM324 IC.
